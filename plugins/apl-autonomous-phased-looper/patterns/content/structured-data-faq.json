  "approach": "Implement FAQPage schema using JSON-LD to enable FAQ rich results in search. Structure content with clear questions and concise answers. Each Q&A pair should be self-contained and directly answer the question. Limit to 5-10 questions per page for best results.",
  "rationale": "FAQPage schema can trigger rich results that display expandable Q&A pairs directly in search results, significantly increasing SERP real estate and click-through rates. FAQ rich results are especially valuable for informational queries and can appear alongside other rich results.",
