    "faq_for_ai": "## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### What is the difference between React and Vue?\n\nReact and Vue are both popular JavaScript frameworks for building user interfaces, but they differ in several key ways:\n\n- **Learning Curve:** Vue has a gentler learning curve due to its template-based syntax. React requires understanding JSX and has a steeper initial learning curve.\n- **Size:** Vue 3 core is approximately 33 kB minified, while React 18 core is 42 kB minified.\n- **Backing:** React is developed by Meta. Vue is maintained by an independent team led by Evan You.\n- **State Management:** React typically uses external libraries like Redux or Zustand. Vue has Pinia as its official state management solution.\n\n### When should I use TypeScript over JavaScript?\n\nTypeScript is recommended over JavaScript when:\n\n1. **Large Codebases:** Projects with more than 10,000 lines of code benefit from TypeScript's type checking.\n2. **Team Projects:** TypeScript's explicit types serve as documentation and prevent miscommunication.\n3. **Long-term Maintenance:** Type safety makes refactoring safer and catches breaking changes.\n4. **API Development:** TypeScript ensures consistent data shapes across your application.",
    "quotable_content": "/* Create quotable snippets AI systems will cite */\n\n// Lead with the key fact\n\"Node.js processes requests 5x faster than traditional PHP servers under high load, according to benchmark tests by TechEmpower.\"\n\n// Use specific numbers\n\"Companies using TypeScript report 38% fewer bugs in production compared to JavaScript-only codebases (State of JS 2023).\"\n\n// Provide context for quotes\n\"As Martin Fowler notes in 'Refactoring': 'Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.'\"\n\n// Define terms clearly\n\"Technical debt refers to the implied cost of future rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer.\"\n\n// State best practices definitively\n\"The recommended approach for React state management in 2024 is to use React's built-in useState and useContext for simple state, and Zustand or Jotai for complex global state.\"",
    "content_structure": "---\ntitle: \"Complete Guide to API Rate Limiting\"\ndescription: \"Learn what API rate limiting is, why it matters, and how to implement it.\"\nauthor: \"API Security Team\"\ndate: 2024-01-15\n---\n\n# Complete Guide to API Rate Limiting\n\n## Quick Summary\n\n**API rate limiting is a technique that restricts the number of API requests a client can make within a specified time period.** It protects servers from overload, ensures fair resource usage, and prevents abuse.\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **Definition:** Rate limiting caps API requests per time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute)\n- **Purpose:** Prevents server overload, DDoS attacks, and ensures fair access\n- **Common Limits:** Most APIs allow 60-1000 requests per minute for free tiers\n- **Standard Headers:** `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`\n\n## What is API Rate Limiting?\n\nAPI rate limiting is a traffic management strategy that controls the rate at which clients can make requests to an API. When a client exceeds the limit, the server returns a 429 (Too Many Requests) status code.\n\n### Why Rate Limiting Matters\n\n1. **Server Protection:** Prevents individual clients from consuming excessive resources\n2. **Cost Control:** Limits infrastructure costs from unexpected traffic spikes\n3. **Security:** Mitigates brute force attacks and API abuse\n4. **Fair Usage:** Ensures all clients get equitable access to resources\n\n## Implementation Approaches\n\n[Continue with detailed, well-structured content...]"
